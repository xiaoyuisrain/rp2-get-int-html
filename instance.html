    <short-instructions>
      <p>Paraphrase the given text and answer subsequent questions.</p>
      <p>
      Your paraphrase should:
      <ol>
        <li>Retain the word form and word order of the non-target words.</li>
        <li>Use literal language as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Sound natural and be grammatically acceptable.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p><i>Please read the full instructions carefully before working on the task.</i></p>
    </short-instructions>
    <full-instructions header="Full instructions of the paraphrasing task">
      <p>Please paraphrase the given text by rewording <em>the emphasised word</em> (the target word).</p>
    <p>You could use words or phrases in place of the target word, and/or insert words between any of the non-target words in the text, as long as the non-target words retain their original word form and word order, and the resulting paraphrase sounds natural and is grammatically acceptable.</p>

    <div class="eg">
      <p>For example, to paraphrase the sentence below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The artist has <em>captured</em> her perfectly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You could insert one or more words in one or all of the blanks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> the artist has <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> her <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> perfectly <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following changes will not be accepted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The artist has <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> her <span class="wrong">precisely</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="wrong">She</span> has been <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> <span class="wrong">by the artist</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>In addition, please try your best to use literal language to paraphrase the text. A literal text expresses meaning directly, and only contains concepts belonging to the topic that the text is about. In particular, it does not use concrete words if the context is abstract, or abstract words if the context is concrete.</p>

    <div class="eg">
      <p>Examples of literal sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have to go to my country to see my father.</li>
        <li>Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated.</li>
        <li>The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of non-literal sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>And tell me, <span class="wrong">sweet</span> creature, do you <span class="wrong">count</span> as a <span class="wrong">toy</span>?</li>
        <li>No longer can the Government <span class="wrong">disguise</span> the crisis <span class="wrong">surrounding</span> electricity privatisation.</li>
        <li>I wouldn't want her to have a <span class="wrong">rough</span> time.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>If you could not decide on a paraphrase, please enter '<span id="value_na">NA</span>' (without the quotation marks) and proceed. Please note, however, that your submission might be rejected if the majority of respondents managed to provide a paraphrase that meets all the requirements.</p>
