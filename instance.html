        <p>Paraphrase the given text by replacing <em>the emphasised word</em> (the target word):
      <ul>
        <li>Retain the word form and word order of the non-target words.</li>
        <li>Make sure your paraphrase sounds natural and is grammatically acceptable.</li>
        <li>Use literal language as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Enter 'NA' if you find the task too hard.</li>
        <li>Return or report the HIT if you could not see any word <em>emphasised</em> in the original text.</li>
        <li>Click the Proceed button everytime you change the paraphrase you would like to submit.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>These HITs will be quality-controlled. Please read the detailed instructions carefully if this is your first time doing our paraphrasing task.</strong></p>
      </short-summary>
      <detailed-instructions>
        <div>
        <strong>Replacing the target word</strong>
    <p>You could use words or phrases in place of the target word, and/or insert words between any of the non-target words in the text, as long as the non-target words retain their original word form and word order, and the resulting paraphrase sounds natural and is grammatically acceptable.</p>

    <div class="eg">
      <p>For example, to paraphrase the sentence below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The artist has <em class="tw">captured</em> her perfectly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You could insert one or more words in one or all of the blanks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> the artist has <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> her <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> perfectly <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following changes will <em>not</em> be accepted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The artist has <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> her <span class="wrong">precisely</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="wrong">She</span> has been <input type="text" class="illustrate" disabled/> <span class="wrong">by the artist</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>If our algorithm thinks your paraphrase modifies any non-target words, it will display <em>a warning message</em> when you click the Proceed button. Please click the button again everytime you change your paraphrase.</p>
    <p>Please also <em>avoid</em> using words in which the target word is somewhat present. For example, please do not substitute the verb <i class="tw">connect</i> with phrases containing <i class="wrong">connection</i> or <i class="wrong">disconnect</i>; inflected forms (<i class="wrong">connects</i>, <i class="wrong">connected</i>, and <i class="wrong">connecting</i>) will not be accepted either.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <strong>Literal language</strong>
    <p>A sentence uses literal language if it expresses meaning directly and only contains concepts belonging to the topic that the sentence is about. In particular, it does not use concrete words if the context is abstract or the other way around.</p>

    <div class="eg">
      <p>Examples of literal sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have to go to my country to see my father.</li>
        <li>Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated.</li>
        <li>The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of non-literal sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>And tell me, <span class="wrong">sweet</span> creature, do you <span class="wrong">count</span> as a <span class="wrong">toy</span>?</li>
        <li>No longer can the Government <span class="wrong">disguise</span> the crisis <span class="wrong">surrounding</span> electricity privatisation.</li>
        <li>I wouldn't want her to have a <span class="wrong">rough</span> time.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
        </div>

        <div><strong>Entering 'NA' in the paraphrase field</strong>
    <p>If you could not decide on a paraphrase (e.g., because you think it is impossible to replace the target word with anything else), please enter '<span id="value_na">NA</span>' (without the quotation marks) and Proceed. Please note, however, that your submission might be rejected if the majority of respondents managed to provide a paraphrase that meets all the requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div><strong>Encountering the same target word</strong>
    <p>Please be cautious when accepting multiple HITs for the same target word (<i>captured</i>, <i>captures</i> and <i>capture</i> are considered the same word). We might have to reject your assignments if the same word is always paraphrased in the same way.</p>
        </div>

      <p>While paraphrasing must be super easy for you, what we regard as <em>usable paraphrases</em> for this particular study might be different from what you would assume or have learned since primary school. We reject assignments that do not meet the basic requirements, so please use your time wisely. Thank you very much.</p>
